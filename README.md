# Screw-Identification-and-Classification-System
This project provides a tool for analyzing and identifying various types of screws, bolts, and nuts based on uploaded images. Using basic feature detection with OpenCV, the tool classifies the screw type and provides detailed information on the detected item, including material, head type, thread type, strength grade, coating, and application. This tool is particularly useful for professionals in manufacturing, construction, and repair who need fast, detailed identification of hardware.

# Features
Image Analysis with OpenCV: Uses edge detection and contour analysis to identify screw types based on visual features.
Comprehensive Screw Database: Includes detailed information for each screw type, covering material, size, head and drive types, and more.
User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to upload an image of a screw and receive detailed information about the screwâ€™s specifications and typical applications.
# Demo
Once an image is uploaded, the tool will:

# Display the image.
Identify and classify the screw type based on contour analysis.
Output a detailed report about the screw, including name, type, material, size, coating, and a description of its typical uses.
# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab)
Required libraries:
OpenCV
